An idea about using Minecraft as a medium to explore, configure and build out a Kubernetes cluster.
---
The plan is to iteratively try and validate, then either continue or call it off.

"MVP"  
- Do everything I can remember about mc plugins and k8s to build it atm.
- Dev goal: Learn how Kubernetes operators work. Revisit the mc serverside plugin community. 
- The goal to validate:
- - Feed information about pods from a specific test k8s service into a Minecraft multiplayer server.
- - Allow one regular mc java client player to interact with the pods, without any /kubectl chat commands, but instead with the pods/Kubernetes resources represented as physical Minecraft structures.
- - Allow the player to get logs for each pod, and change the replica count of services. 
- Do this as a 'sprint' of 5 business days split over 3/4 weeks of my spare time.

"Requisition"  
- Use the MVP as an opportunity to learn about GitHub project management stuff, and publically try to document something opensource.
- Do another 5-day sprint over free time, this time focusing on the Minecraft map/ MVC view layer stuff, as the first sprint will probably really focus on the networking stuff.
- Document this, in the same way, I documented the MVP.
- Write a medium article or whack out the bmc.

"??"
We'll see how much we use the project planning tools.

At the end hopefully, I'll end up with a fun medium article on if a bad workman blames his tools, or if a Minecraft world might be bad tooling for orchestration management. 

Always looking for contributors,
Setup instructions and tooling on the way.
